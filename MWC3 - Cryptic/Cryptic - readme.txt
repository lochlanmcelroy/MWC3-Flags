CRYPTIC

Difficulty: Beginner

between hexagon walls where the books never end, my verses are waiting, my lines twist and bend. infinite volumes, yet one holds my name, a page in the chaos, always the same. no scribe has penned me, yet here i remain, typed into nothing, then found once again. search where all words have already been spun, tell me my place, page and book.
